To-do:
- New directory structure: pipeline, with formatters and peridot substitution engine as subdirs
- Peridot substitution engine: insert engine into overall pipeline after existing formatter infra.
  - dynamic substitution module system
  - standard handler class, with support for inline, full-line, and multi-line substitutions as subclass methods
  - config options to specify substitution aliases, default substitution module options, etc.
  - support for adding substitution modules via the plugin loader

Future extensibility:
- structure allows for easy migration to a fully dynamic approach

Development for later phase plans:
- fully modular dynamic pipeline
- integrate peridot tightly with phase 3 (CGI frameworks)
